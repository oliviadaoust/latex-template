@book{wooldridge2002econometric,
abstract = {This graduate text provides an intuitive but rigorous treatment of contemporary methods used in microeconometric research. The book makes clear that applied microeconometrics is about the estimation of marginal and treatment effects, and that parametric estimation is simply a means to this end. It also clarifies the distinction between causality and statistical association.The book focuses specifically on cross section and panel data methods. Population assumptions are stated separately from sampling assumptions, leading to simple statements as well as to important insights. The unified approach to linear and nonlinear models and to cross section and panel data enables straightforward coverage of more advanced methods. The numerous end-of-chapter problems are an important component of the book. Some problems contain important points not fully described in the text, and others cover new ideas that can be analyzed using tools presented in the current and previous chapters. Several problems require the use of the data sets located at the author's website.},

@article{gleditsch_armed_2002,
abstract = {In the period 1946-2001, there were 225 armed conflicts and 34 of them were active in all of or part of 2001. Armed conflict remains a serious problem in the post-Cold War period. For three decades, the Correlates of War project has served as the main supplier of reliable data used in longitudinal studies of external and internal armed conflict. The COW datasets on war use the relatively high threshold of 1,000 battle-deaths. The Uppsala dataset on armed conflict has a lower threshold, 25 annual battle-deaths, but has so far been available for only the post-Cold War period. This dataset has now been backdated to the end of World War II. This article presents a report on armed conflict based on this backdate as well as another annual update. It presents the procedures for the backdating, as well as trends over time and breakdowns for the type of conflict. It assesses the criteria for measuring armed conflict and discusses some directions for future data collection in this area.},

@article{Chaturvedi2005,
abstract = {In most developing countries even today, political parties spend a substantial fraction of their resources in attracting voters through ideological exhortation as well as force. In this paper we present a model of political contest between two parties that compete in two distinct arenas though the goal of the contest in both arenas is the same-to garner more political support. In the first, which we call "ideological", the contest involves no use of force. In the second, which we call "conflictual", party activists use violence either to force ideological supporters of the competing party to vote in their favor or restrain them from voting. We show that a party with lower initial political support will resort to more political violence, ceteris paribus and as the fraction of undecided voters goes up, elections will tend to be less conflictual. We also show that if there is an incumbency advantage, then the resources devoted to creating political unrest increase in equilibrium and political competition is more violent. We also provide some historic and journalistic evidence that supports our results.},

abstract = {We study the effect of civil conflict on social capital, focusing on Uganda's experience during the last decade. Using individual and county-level data, we document large causal effects on trust and ethnic identity of an exogenous outburst of ethnic conflicts in 2002-2005. We exploit two waves of survey data from Afrobarometer (Round 4 Afrobarometer Survey in Uganda, , ), including information on socioeconomic characteristics at the individual level, and geo-referenced measures of fighting events from ACLED. Our identification strategy exploits variations in the both the spatial and ethnic intensity of fighting. We find that more intense fighting decreases generalized trust and increases ethnic identity. The effects are quantitatively large and robust to a number of control variables, alternative measures of violence, and different statistical techniques involving ethnic and spatial fixed effects and instrumental variables. Controlling for the intensity of violence during the conflict, we also document that post-conflict economic recovery is slower in ethnically fractionalized counties. Our findings are consistent with the existence of a self-reinforcing process between conflicts and ethnic cleavages. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of propaganda on participation in violent con- ict. I examine the eects of the infamous "hate radio" station Radio RTLM that called for the extermination of the Tutsi ethnic minority population before and dur- ing the 1994 Rwanda Genocide. I develop a model of participation in ethnic violence where radio broadcasts a noisy public signal about the value of violence. I then test the models predictions using a nation-wide village-level dataset on radio coverage and prosecutions for genocide violence. To identify causal eects, I exploit arguably exoge- nous variation in radio coverage generated by hills in the line-of-sight between radio transmitters and villages. Consistent with the model under strategic complements in violence, I nd that Radio RTLM increased participation in violence, that the eects were decreasing in ethnic polarization, highly non-linear in radio coverage, and decreas- ing in literacy rates. Finally, the estimated eects are substantial. Complete village radio coverage increased violence by 65 to 77 percent, and a simple counter-factual calculation suggests that approximately 9 percent of the genocide, corresponding to at least 45 000 Tutsi deaths, can be explained by the radio station.},

@article{Anderson2008,
abstract = {The view that the returns to educational investments are highest for early childhood interventions is widely held and stems primarily from several influential randomized trials—Abecedarian, Perry, and the Early Training Project—that point to super-normal returns to early interventions. This article presents a de novo analysis of these experiments, focusing on two core issues that have received limited attention in previous analyses: treatment effect heterogeneity by gender and overrejection of the null hypothesis due to multiple inference. To address the latter issue, a statistical framework that combines summary index tests with familywise error rate and false discovery rate corrections is implemented. The first technique reduces the number of tests conducted; the latter two techniques adjust the p values for multiple inference. The primary finding of the reanalysis is that girls garnered substantial short- and long-term benefits from the interventions, but there were no significant long-term benefits for boys. These conclusions, which have appeared ambiguous when using “naive” estimators that fail to adjust for multiple testing, contribute to a growing literature on the emerging female–male academic achievement gap. They also demonstrate that in complex studies where multiple questions are asked of the same data set, it can be important to declare the family of tests under consideration and to either consolidate measures or report adjusted and unadjusted p values.},

abstract = {This article introduces a special issue on the micro-level dynamics of mass violent conflict. While most analyses of conflict typically adopt a regional, national or global perspective, often using country-level data, this special issue takes an explicit micro-level approach, focusing on the behaviour and welfare of individuals, households and groups or communities. At a fundamental level, conflict originates from individuals' behaviour and their repeated interactions with their surroundings, in other words, from its micro-foundations. A micro-level approach advances our understanding of conflict by its ability to account for individual and group heterogeneity within one country or one conflict. The contributors to this special issue investigate the nature of violence against civilians, the agency of civilians during conflict, the strategic interaction between civilians and armed actors, the consequences of displacement, the effectiveness of coping strategies and the impact of policy interventions. The core message from these articles is that in order to understand conflict dynamics and its effects on society, we have to take seriously the incentives and constraints shaping the interaction between the civilian population and the armed actors. The kind of interaction that develops, as well as the resulting conflict dynamics, depend on the type of conflict, the type of armed actors and the characteristics of the civilian population and its institutions.},

abstract = {Voter education campaigns often aim to increase political participation and accountability. We followed a randomized campaign against electoral violence sponsored by an international NGO during the 2007 Nigerian elections. This paper investigates whether the effects of the campaign were transmitted indirectly through kinship, chatting, and geographical proximity. For individuals personally targeted by campaigners, we estimate the reinforcement effect of proximity to other targeted individuals. For individuals who self-report to be untargeted by campaigners, we estimate the diffusion of the campaign depending on proximity to targeted individuals. We find evidence for both effects, particularly on perceptions of violence. Effects are large in magnitude - often similar to the average effect of the campaign. Kinship is the strongest channel of reinforcement and diffusion. We also find that geographical proximity transmits simple effects on perceptions, and that chatting conveys more complex effects on behavior. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

This pattern is not driven by differences in local geographic features or by other observable ethnic-specific cultural and economic variables. The strong positive association between pre-colonial political complexity and contemporary development also holds within pairs of adjacent ethnic homelands with different legacies of pre-colonial political institutions.},

abstract = {Considerable resources are devoted to ex-combatant reintegration programs in current peace processes, but evidence on their effectiveness remains thin. We use original survey data to study an ex-combatant reintegration program implemented after Burundi's 1993-2004 civil war. Previous quantitative studies have found reintegration programs to be ineffective, but only ex-combatants who self-selected into programs were studied. We avoid such selection problems with a quasi-experimental design exploiting an exogenous bureaucratic failure. We find the program resulted in a 20 to 35 percentage point reduction in poverty incidence among ex-combatants and moderate improvement in livelihoods. But this economic boost does not seem to have caused political reintegration: while we find a modest increase in propensities to report civilian life as preferable to combatant life, we find no evidence that the program contributed to either more satisfaction with the peace process or a more positive disposition toward current government institutions.},

@article{Lemarchand2002,
abstract = {Vingt-deux ans avant l'h\'{e}catombe du Rwanda, qui fit environ 600 000 victimes, la plupart tutsi, un autre g\'{e}nocide ensanglantait la r\'{e}gion des Grands Lacs: entre 200 000 et 300 000 Hutu furent massacr\'{e}s par l'arm\'{e}e du Burundi \`{a} la suite d'une r\'{e}bellion hutu qui fit des milliers de victimes chez les Tutsi. Au Rwanda comme au Burundi le meurtre de masse porte tous les signes distinctifs du g\'{e}nocide: le ciblage ethnique des victimes, l'intentionnalit\'{e} exterminatrice, l'ampleur des tueries. \`{A} la diff\'{e}rence du Rwanda, ou l'ethnie des g\'{e}nocidaires fut \'{e}cart\'{e}e du pouvoir, au Burundi c'est la minorit\'{e} tutsi qui devait r\'{e}gner sans partage sur les destin\'{e}es du pays, jusqu'en 1993. Ceci explique le silence officiel qui, jusqu'\`{a} aujourd'hui, entoure le g\'{e}nocide de 1972. Cette mise entre parenth\`{e}ses des atrocit\'{e}s commises en 1972 a non seulement contribu\'{e} \`{a} obscurcir leurs relations avec celles de 1994 au Rwanda voisin, mais a cr\'{e}\'{e} un non-dit officiel qui aggrave les tensions entre les communaut\'{e}s hutu et tutsi. Au Burundi comme au Rwanda le moment est venu de proc\'{e}der \`{a} de v\'{e}ritables "retrouvailles de la m\'{e}moire", et, ce faisant, de reconna\^{\i}tre que la culpabilit\'{e} n'est pas une voie \`{a} sens unique. Le plus grand danger qui menace la r\'{e}gion des Grands Lacs est celui d'une m\'{e}moire ethnicis\'{e}e, o\`{u} chaque groupe se dispute le privil\`{e}ge de d\'{e}tenir la v\'{e}rit\'{e}, et o\`{u} l'histoire d\'{e}partage les bons des mauvais suivant l'appartenance ethnique. Twenty-two years before the Rwandan hecatomb with approximately 600 000 casualties (mostly Tutsi), another genocide bloodied the African Great Lakes region when, following a Hutu rebellion that had felled thousands of Tutsi victims, Burundi's army massacred from 200 000 to 300 000 Hutu. In Rwanda as in Burundi, mass murder bore all the characteristic marks of genocide: the ethnic targeting of victims, the intention to exterminate, the scope of the killings. Unlike in Rwanda, where those who committed the genocide belonged to the ethnic group that had been kept out of power, the Tutsi minority in Burundi ruled without sharing power till 1993. This accounts for the official silence that even yet surrounds the 1972 genocide. This silence has obscured the relations between the 1972 events in Burundi and those in neighboring Rwanda in 1994. This official silence has also caused tensions to mount between the Hutu and Tutsi. In Burundi as in Rwanda, the time has come to "restore memory" and thus recognize that guilt is not one-sided. The major danger menacing this region is an "ethnicized memory", as each group claims to be the keeper of the truth, and as history separates the good from the bad on an ethnic basis.},

abstract = {The study of ethnicity is dominated by constructivist approaches, yet empirical studies of civil war have been oblivious to their insights. In this article, the author examines the relationship between ethnic identity and civil war and points to several empirical instances of fluidity in the behavioral expression of ethnic identities within civil war. The author identifies two processes that are consistent with constructivist theorizing: identity shift and ethnic defection. The author provides several empirical illustrations along with a micro-level test of the determinants of ethnic defection. At the micro level, ethnic defection is best predicted by the extent of territorial control exercised by the incumbent political actor and the level of prior insurgent violence. The author also hypothesizes that at the macro level, ethnic defection is a function of the resources available to incumbent actors and conclude by stressing the need to take seriously the endogenous dynamics of civil wars.},

abstract = {In this article, we provide a systematic analysis of the extent to which political, economic, and cultural factors are associated with civil wars in the post-colonial states of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Results of logistic regression analyses corroborate previous findings that semi-democracy is associated with an increased likelihood of civil war, while greater economic development reduces the probability of civil war. We also found that militarized post-colonial states are more likely to experience civil war, as are Asian — more than Middle Eastern and African — states. Among the political, economic, and cultural factors, semi-democracy has the greatest impact on the probability of civil war, which suggests the greater role of political — more than economic or cultural — factors in post-colonial civil wars. All told, the findings suggest that a multifaceted strategy of full democratization, demilitarization, and development is required to reduce the likelihood of civil war in post-colonial states.},

Faced with the inability of the state police to provide full security in the urban areas of Uganda and Sierra Leone, there has been a diversification of policing agen-cies. This paper will explore the range of options available beyond the state police. It examines who is authorising and delivering this multi-choice po-licing; how effective and accountable the different authorisers/providers of policing are; and what contrasts are there between Uganda and Sierra Leone and why? It finds that on the basis of the state ability to provide law and order and crime control within its territorial boundaries, sovereignty is certainly weak if not fragmented in the two countries. However, for histori-cal reasons the two emerging patterns of sovereignty are not identical.},

@article{urdal,
abstract = {Demographic and environmental factors have claimed a dominant position in the post-Cold War security discourse. According to the neo-Malthusian conflict scenario, population pressure on natural renewable resources makes societies more prone to low-intensity civil war. On the contrary, resource-optimists concede that agricultural land scarcity caused by high population density may be a driving factor behind economic development, thus causing peace in a long-term perspective. These notions are tested in a quantitative cross-national time-series study covering the 1950-2000 period. The results do not provide strong support for either perspective. Countries experiencing high rates of population growth, high rates of urbanization, or large refugee populations do not face greater risks of internal armed conflict. There is some indication that scarcity of potential cropland may have a pacifying effect. However, where land scarcity combines with high rates of population growth, the risk of armed conflict increases somewhat. This trend is particularly marked for the 1970s, the decade that saw the great rise in neo-Malthusian concerns. Claims that the world has entered a new age of insecurity' after the end of the Cold War, where demographic and environmental factors threaten security and state stability, appear to be unfounded. Overall, the robustness of the empirical support for both paradigms is low. A strong emphasis on security as a macro rationale for reducing global population growth thus seems unwarranted.},
