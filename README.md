PhD template in Latex

Most of the .tex is documented. 

Only the bibliography style has some specific features: I use Mendeley as reference manager (https://www.mendeley.com/) and recommend it.
It allows you to synchronize your references with a .bib file, that you can save in your Dropbox (or another cloud). 

The "bibstyle_wp.bst" allows you to have working paper series. They should be stored under the "Report" type, and the field "institution" has to be the series, and the field "issue" will be the number of the WP. 
The WP that are not part of a series should be under the "Thesis" type, and will appear with "mimeo." written at the end. 
The "generic" type only contains the title. 

The rest is as usual.
